But yeah, in regards to the ""31st Dec no snow issue"" I have managed to do some further investigations on my own and found out that: Firstly, the event is still ending *after 14 Jan 2020*. Secondly, it was really weird that only 31st Dec does not have any festival effects, ~~which seems as though someone forgot December has 31 days and coded in only 30 days instead~~. And lastly, it doesn't seems to be overwritten by any other events since nothing ended up happening on that day, so it shouldn't be a surprise New Year Eve either. So what do you have to do? Nothing much in particular. It probably feels bad having to waste a day onto not doing anything, but it will be Christmas again after 31st Dec... though that sounds weird. And if you are actually climbing for the presents since yesterday, maybe it would be a better idea to hold off the logging in for today since reaching the peak won't trigger any gifts quotes from Kubo at all either ways, at least that's what I think.
