> Investigating the computer-mediated communications (CMCs) in an online
community that specialized in communications for gamers, this paper successfully replicates the
prior results of politeness function of emoticons on emoji. In addition, this paper demonstrates that
when a speaker whose primary language has richer elements for politeness communicates politely
in English, that speaker is more likely to use emoji and emoticons than a speaker whose primary
language has less rich elements for politeness. The paper also simulates a simple listener model
which suggests that the presence emoji or emoticons may increase the likelihood of perceiving an
utterance as more polite.

### Reproducing this project
1. Clean and process the data using [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/wanitchayap/Content-Analysis-Final-Project/blob/master/polite_emoji.ipynb). If you want to skip this process, the cleaned and processed files are also 
provided in the repository.
2. Analyze the data using this [R code](https://github.com/wanitchayap/Content-Analysis-Final-Project/blob/master/polite_emoji.Rmd) ([rendered version](https://github.com/wanitchayap/Content-Analysis-Final-Project/blob/master/polite_emoji.md))

### Note for Computational Content Analysis course
Techniques used in this project are from:
* *Week 0* - scraping emoticons from Wikipedia  
* *Week 1* - processing texts and counting  
* *Week 3* - supervised classification    

Even though the techniques used in this project are considered simple, I believe they are the most suitable for and sufficient to answer my research question.
