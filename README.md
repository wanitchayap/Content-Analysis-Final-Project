Wanitchaya Poonpatanapricha

> Investigating the computer-mediated communications (CMCs) in an online
community that specialized in communications for gamers, this paper successfully replicates the
prior results of politeness function of emoticons on emoji. In addition, this paper demonstrates that
when a speaker whose primary language has richer elements for politeness communicates politely
in English, that speaker is more likely to use emoji and emoticons than a speaker whose primary
language has less rich elements for politeness. The paper also simulates a simple listener model
which suggests that the presence emoji or emoticons may increase the likelihood of perceiving an
utterance as more polite.
